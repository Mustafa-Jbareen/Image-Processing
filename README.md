# Image Processing Homework Assignments
This repository contains five homework assignments completed during an Image Processing course. Each assignment explores various key topics and techniques in the field.

## Homework 1: Image Enhancement and Filtering
This homework covers image enhancement techniques such as histogram equalization, contrast adjustment, and spatial filtering (smoothing and sharpening) to improve image quality. The task involved using filters to reduce noise and enhance features in images.

## Homework 2: Frequency Domain Filtering (FFT)
In this assignment, I transformed images into the frequency domain using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and applied low-pass and high-pass filters. This allowed the analysis of different frequency components and their effect on blurring, sharpening, and image clarity.

## Homework 3: Edge Detection
This homework focused on detecting sharp transitions in intensity within images using methods like Sobel and Canny edge detectors. The task was to tune the edge detectors for optimal performance in identifying object boundaries while minimizing noise.

## Homework 4: Image Segmentation
This assignment explored image segmentation techniques like global and adaptive thresholding and region-based methods such as the watershed algorithm. The aim was to divide images into meaningful sections for analysis, separating objects from the background.

## Homework 5: Morphological Operations
In this homework, I implemented morphological operations such as dilation, erosion, opening, and closing to refine object shapes and remove noise from binary images. These techniques helped enhance image structure for further analysis or recognition tasks.
